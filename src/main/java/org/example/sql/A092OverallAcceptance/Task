Requirements:

    Write an SQL query to calculate the acceptance rate.

    The result should be a single decimal number rounded to two decimal places.

    Handle edge cases where there might be no friend requests or no acceptances.

Input:

    Two tables: friend_request and request_accepted with columns sender_id, send_to_id, request_date, requester_id, accepter_id, and accept_date respectively.

Output:

    A single decimal number representing the overall acceptance rate.

Examples: If there are 10 friend requests and 8 of them are accepted, the acceptance rate would be 0.80.

Constraints:

    The sender_id and send_to_id in the friend_request table will be distinct.

    The requester_id and accepter_id in the request_accepted table will be distinct.

    All IDs are positive integers.

Expected Time Complexity:

    Depends on the database engine and the amount of data but ideally should run in reasonable time for up to 1 million rows.

Expected Auxiliary Space:

    No additional space is required other than the space for the SQL query itself.

Hint:

    Consider using a LEFT JOIN operation to merge the two tables based on the IDs.

    The IFNULL SQL function can help handle cases where there are no acceptances.

Note:

    Ensure to always round the result to two decimal places for consistency.
