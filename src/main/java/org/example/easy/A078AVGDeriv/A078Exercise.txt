Standard Deviation - Statistical Operations

Introduction: The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

STEPS:

    Calculate the mean (average) of the dataset.

    For each data point, find the square of its distance to the mean.

    Sum up all the squared results from step 2.

    Divide this sum by the number of data points to get the variance.

    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

Requirements:

    Implement the function findStandardDeviation(int[] data).

    The function should return a double.

    The function should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the dataset is empty or null.

Input:

    An array of integers, data[]data[].

Output:

    A double representing the standard deviation of the dataset.
