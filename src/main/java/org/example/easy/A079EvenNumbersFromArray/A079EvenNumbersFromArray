Introduction: Arrays are fundamental constructs in computer science. Extracting specific elements based on certain criteria, like even numbers, is a frequent operation in data processing. In this challenge, learners will focus on traversing arrays and applying basic mathematical operations to filter out even numbers.

STEPS:
    Check if the input array is null. If it is, throw an IllegalArgumentException.
    Traverse the array once to count the number of even numbers.
    Create a new array with a size equal to the number of even numbers.
    Traverse the array again, this time adding even numbers to the new array.
    Return the array of even numbers.

Requirements:
    Implement the function extractEvenNumbers(int[] arr).
    The function should return an array of integers.
    The function should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the input array is null.

Input:
    An array of integers, arr[] arr[].

Output:
    An array of integers representing the even numbers extracted from the input array.
